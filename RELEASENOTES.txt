	Update mkdatasummary.py to restructure legacy data
	Added hostnames to the reports

Note that when upgrading to 1.5.5 or later from 1.5.4 or earlier, all existing
pathdiag reports in the server directory (/ServerData/ in the default config)
will be moved to subdirectories using the new naming convention
(/ServerData/Reports-yyyy-mm/).  This will break all bookmarked URLs to past
reports.  Given an old URL, it can be corrected by either inserting
"Reports-yyyy-mm/" (for current months) or replacing "OldReports" by "Reports"
(for past reports).  Version 1.5.4 and earlier renamed reports into
subdirectories once they were more than two months old.  The under the new
convention, reports URLs will be stable as long as they remain on the server.

==== There are no release notes for prior versions.
