TODO list for pathdiag

Pick stepsize from RTT
Reverse loss measurement and queue measurment
fix rwnd logic to generate a warning if actual window is too small

HISTORICAL TODO LIST

The short list
  Do something about testerMBZ X_OtherReductionsCV
  Put in general gate_ scan_ markers in the autoscan
  Add tester limits to diagserver and config (--maxtime and/or --maxwindow)
  make "can't measure queue size" more generic
  hide or make warning all tester validations

Pathtools library and other low level features
  When failing to set cwnd controls
     return to python and check for BIC before punting
  better message for obsolete kernel DONE
  Support for setting section MTU down to end-to-end MTU  WAITING for kernel
    Better MTU messages 
  Future automatic (self scaling) coarse scan
    Parameters to bound queue size
    User mode "Limited slowstart" implementation
  Future power maximizing controller

Pathdiag data collection (autoscan etc)
  Accept floats for rtt and datarate
  Add mechanism to save "events" between test and report generation  DONE
  Easy end-to-end coarse scan test (option) 
    Yield parameters for section-by-section testing
  General support for known queue size limits in the path
  Rethink total run duration and watchdog limits DONE

Pathdiag report generation
  Unified sub-test display messages and logic INPROGRESS
  Distinguish between host config and running problems 
  Diagnose: can't overflow queue due to TCP problems (can't raise cwnd)
  Diagnose Timeouts: window too small v abrupt v CC problems
  Make loss rate message clearly one way (no report on return loss)
  handle X_OtherReductionsCV correctly
  handle CongestionOverCount correctly

Diagnnostic server/test environment:
  Option to have the diagnostic client set socket buffer size
    Emulate application (manual) buffer tuning  (-A switch)
    0:default -1:system max n:set to size
    tool set/procedure to validate perftune directions
  Server options for longer duration, smaller steps (and MTU) (+ add in clients)

  Tools to better collect, inspect and manage results from many servers
    Save file names to a shared log file NIX
    Tools to detect additional servers from weblogs
    Tool to review and select "regression" cases from saved results
  Collection of regression tests for pretesting new releases

Other documentation
  URGENT: real MS-XP instructions on the tcp tuning guide DONE
  Update solaris on tcptune (per heffner) DONE
  Correct FreeBSD per petka DONE

NEW ITEMS (unclassified&unprioritized)
Do not advise tests > 100Mb/s if forbidden by server NIX
autologfile name
automatically link help.html and boxes.css
Where to discuss application specific syn negotiation failures
Documentation clearer about required interface rates
INSTALL doc warn not to upgrade w/o restarting (or find the bug)

==
Following "long path" version
ETF limits problem go to a DBP limit?
    - make this a config parameter?
server tuning directions relative to the DBP limit?
phase info (and other per test meta data) into logfile
make replay long paths work DONE
make cvs version say so on web page
Need a way to capture stdout and stderr
Need to address the sendtuning during slowstart problem
Verify proper queusize rescan logic: is quench being rest?  Add nonconv test

Spurious tester bottleneck message?  See:
